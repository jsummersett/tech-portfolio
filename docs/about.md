title: About
---

I am a junior at Vassar College, pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I currently work as a Teaching Assistant for a discrete mathematics computer science course at Vassar, while also serving as CS Liaison for Vassar's Gender Inclusivity in STEM and Treasurer of my residential dorm. My work experience includes advising a local finance firm on the implementation of cloud-based financial applications, as well as a plethora of positions in customer service. In my free time, I enjoy all things theatrical and musical, with a side of baking. 

Before I declared my major, I explored courses in the Geography, Theater, Religion, Music, Economics, and International Politics departments. These courses challenged my critical thinking, as well as broadened my compassion, communication, and writing skills. I discovered my passion in a Cognitive Science class after investigating Alan Turing's infamous creation, the Turing machine. From there, I explored my interest and developed skills through club projects, hackathons, datafests, and online courses.


## What I’m Looking For

I am drawn to a career in technology because I love the way it combines mathematical reasoning and programming to help people understand their world and educate those around them. I am passionate about the impact technology can have on accessibility and information, and strive to work for a company that values integrity, collaboration and passion like I do. This summer, I hope to secure an internship in which I’ll be challenged to grow and develop practical, technological resources for the public.
