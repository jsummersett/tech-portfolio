### Analysis of NYS Occupations Affected by the COVID-19 Shutdown (Vassar Virtual COVID-19 Datafest, May 2020):

Top 4 Finalist for Best Analysis

This project was extremely rewarding and my first look into the realm of data science. 
Using the US government’s Department of Labor’s “Characteristics of the Insured Unemployed” data, we performed basic difference-in-difference techniques on the top two
occupations with the highest levels of insured unemployment, and the top two occupations with the lowest levels of insured unemployment, in April of 2020 in New York state. We used this technique to see whether the “treatment” of New York shutdown correlated with a deviation from the expected rate of change in unemployment trends of previous years. We found that for all occupations addressed, the rate of change in insured unemployment in the pre-treatment period (before March) did not significantly differ from the trend of previous years (2011-2019), whereas it differed in the post-treatment period (March-April). While no occupations appear to have escaped rising unemployment, some deviated more than others for than others from previous years post-treatment trends. Military specific and farming, fishing, and forestry occupations deviated less than food service and office and administrative support occupations.
