### Analysis of NYS Occupations Affected by the COVID-19 Shutdown (Vassar Virtual COVID-19 Datafest, May 2020):

Top 4 Finalist for Best Analysis

This project was extremely rewarding and my first look into the realm of data science. My team and I chose to compare NY's unemployment claims in correspondence with the state's order to shutdown non-essential businesses.
Using the US government’s Department of Labor’s “Characteristics of the Insured Unemployed” data, we performed basic difference-in-difference techniques on the top two occupations with the highest levels of insured unemployment, and the top two occupations with the lowest levels of insured unemployment, in April of 2020 in New York state. We used this technique to see whether the “treatment” of the New York shutdown correlated with a deviation from the expected rate of change in unemployment trends of previous years. We found that for all occupations addressed, the rate of change in insured unemployment in the pre-treatment period (before March) did not significantly differ from the trend of previous years (2011-2019), whereas it differed in the post-treatment period (March-April). While no occupations appear to have escaped rising unemployment, some deviated more than others from previous years' post-treatment trends. The sub-occupations 'Military-specific' and 'Farming, fishing, and forestry' deviated less than 'Food service' and 'Office and administrative support' occupations.

### Website Portfolio for artist Julie Castrodale Miller (Jan. 2021):
#### [juliecastrodalemiller.com](https://juliecastrodalemiller.com)

Developed a website for encaustic artist Julie Castrodale Miller based in Walla Walla, WA. I reached out to the client with a website proposal, as well as information regarding the cost and expense of upkeep (including domain names and hosting). I consulted the client about her needs and aesthetic, and continued to check-in after each major update. I utilized WordPress, HTML, and CSS to design the porfolio, gallery, and additional pages. I will work with the artist to allow direct sales on the website later this year.

### Map California Homes for Wildfire Relief and the American Red Cross (Open Source Day - vGHC, Sept. 2020):

OpenStreetMaps is an open-source map utilized by the American Red Cross and other humanitarian relief organizations. I contributed by verifying 50 acres of the wildfire-endangered area of San Jose, CA and personally adding over 1,000 homes. The information we generated is used by firefighters to prioritize civilian homes, the American Red Cross to deliver aid to victims, and is even used to assess property loss and damage.


## In Progress:

#### Developing an Android app to make the Vassar dining experience more predictable
I am developing in Linux and Android Studio while collaborating with a group of four and sharing resources via GitHub. We began by brainstorming features to include in the application, including a favorites filter, feedback section, and push notifications.
