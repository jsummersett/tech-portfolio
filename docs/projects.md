### Analysis of NYS Occupations Affected by the COVID-19 Shutdown (Vassar Virtual COVID-19 Datafest, May 2020):

Top 4 Finalist for Best Analysis

This project was extremely rewarding and my first look into the realm of data science. My team and I chose to compare NY's unemployment claims in correspondence with the state's order to shutdown non-essential businesses.
Using the US government’s Department of Labor’s “Characteristics of the Insured Unemployed” data, we performed basic difference-in-difference techniques on the top two occupations with the highest levels of insured unemployment, and the top two occupations with the lowest levels of insured unemployment, in April of 2020 in New York state. We used this technique to see whether the “treatment” of the New York shutdown correlated with a deviation from the expected rate of change in unemployment trends of previous years. We found that for all occupations addressed, the rate of change in insured unemployment in the pre-treatment period (before March) did not significantly differ from the trend of previous years (2011-2019), whereas it differed in the post-treatment period (March-April). While no occupations appear to have escaped rising unemployment, some deviated more than others from previous years' post-treatment trends. The sub-occupations 'Military-specific' and 'Farming, fishing, and forestry' deviated less than 'Food service' and 'Office and administrative support' occupations.

## In Progress:

#### Developing an aggregator for a consolidation of California wildfire mutual-aid requests
For this project, I'm engineering a spreadsheet parser that inserts data into MySQL schema and tables, as well as utilizing Django and Bootstrap to develop a simple website to display the requests.
